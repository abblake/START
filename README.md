# START Dynamic Strategy Tool v1.1

**Welcome to START Github page!**  
Our intention in creating this Github page is to enable users to provide feedback about the START Tool. This includes but is not limited to additional variables, reporting known database issues, and/or reporting issues with the tool itself. Additionally, this Github page provides the R scripts for everything we use in the implementation  of the tool.   

  
  
Thank you!  
-Andrew, Oleg, Tim, and Aaron

**Notes on release:**  
The tool supports sample selection based on firms on the New York Stock Exchange. Future releases will support other stock exchanges based on need.  
**Notes on output:**  
The script will output two files. One file is a large dataset that includes ALL variables from the WRDS databases accessed. The second file will end with **_small** which includes the variables selected, firm information, and date information only.
