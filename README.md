# START Dynamic Strategy Tool

**Welcome to START Github page!**  
Our intention in creating this Github page is to enable users to provide feedback about the START Tool. This includes by is not limited to additional variables, reporting known database issues, and/or reporting issues with the tool itself. Additionally, this Github page provides the R scripts for everything we use in the implementation  of the tool.   

  
  
Thank you!
